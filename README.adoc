Provides the Docker image that is used in link:{url-artemis}[Artemis] to run the automatic tests for Haskell exercises.


== Updating

When updating the Stack resolver version, a new tag named `vMAJOR.MINOR.0` has to be published.

In Artemis, the Docker image reference has to be changed in `src/main/resources/config/application.yml`.
The Stack version has to be updated in a few places:

* `src/main/resources/templates/haskell/exercise/stack.yaml`
* `src/main/resources/templates/haskell/solution/stack.yaml`
* `src/main/resources/templates/haskell/test/stack.yaml`
